## select * from logs;

[Tailpipe](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app) is the **lightweight**, **developer-friendly** way to query logs. 

**Use SQL**. It's been the data access standard for decades.

**Run locally**. Collect logs from diverse sources direct to your laptop.

**Build huge collections**. Hundreds of millions of log entries? No problem.

**Query instantly**. Slice through all those entries in seconds.

## Demo time!

## Documentation

See the [documentation](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/docs) for:

- [Getting started](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/docs)
- [It's just SQL!](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/docs/sql)
- [Managing Tailpipe](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/docs/manage)
- [CLI commands](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/docs/reference/cli)

## Install Tailpipe

Install Tailpipe from the [downloads](https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/downloads) page:

```sh
# MacOS
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
```

```
# Linux or Windows (WSL2)
sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tailpipe-io.vercel.app/install/steampipe.sh)"
```

## Install a plugin

Install a plugin for your favorite service (e.g. [AWS](https://hub.tailpipe-io.vercel.app/plugins/turbot/aws), [Azure](https://hub.tailpipe-io.vercel.app/plugins/turbot/azure), [GCP](https://hub.tailpipe-io.vercel.app/plugins/turbot/gcp), [GitHub](https://hub.tailpipe-io.vercel.app/plugins/turbot/github).

```sh
steampipe plugin install aws
```

## Configure a collection

Details vary by plugin and source. To collect AWS CloudTrail logs, config can be as simple as:

```hcl
connection "aws" "prod" {
  profile = "SSO-Admin-605...13981"
}

partition "aws_cloudtrail_log" "prod" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.prod
    bucket     = "aws-cloudtrail-logs-6054...81-fe67"
  }
}
```

## Run a collection

```
tailpipe collect aws_cloudtrail_log.prod
```

This command will:

- Acquire compressed (.gz) log files

- Uncompress them

- Parse all the .json log files and map fields of each line to the plugin-defined schema

- Store the data in Parquet organized by date

## Query!

List the top 10 events and how many times they were called.

```sql
tailpipe query
>  select
  event_source,
  event_name,
  count(*) as event_count
from
  aws_cloudtrail_log
group by
  event_source,
  event_name,
order by
  event_count desc
limit 10;
```

```
